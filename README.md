# 👋 Hey there! I'm Vedant Shirbhate

I'm an engineering student who loves building things that blend **technology, problem-solving, and real impact**.  
I enjoy working across **frontend, mobile, backend, AI/ML, and Web3**, and I'm constantly exploring how technology can create meaningful experiences.

Outside of programming, I’m fascinated by **space, cosmology, and the mysteries of the universe** — black holes, cosmic evolution, multiverse theories, you name it. Anything that expands perspective fuels my curiosity.
